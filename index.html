        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>In the aftermath of a human colony settled on a far-away planet at the outskirts of the galaxy, only sentient machines remain. <br> These machines continue to pursue their owners biddings, even though their owners are no longer present to oversee their actions.</p>

        <p>The decades following the collapse of the human colony have enabled the brewing of the conditions needed for growing militarization of newly formed synthetic societies - as they struggle to maintain power.</p>

        <h2>Conflict</h2>
        <p>Acting on behalf of their owners and legacy programming, the sentient machines are extending the reach of their "human ancestors", while lacking one critical parameter - a fear from consequences.</p>

        <p>The operations carried out by the 'Backward Engaged' entities are taking a toll on their hosting planet, turning it into a temporary time bomb.</p>

        <h2>Climax</h2>
        <p>Decades into the aftermath of human collapse, the balance of authority and power of the ruling class of sentient machines begins to dwindle in the face of increasingly rising connections and direct communications between their subjected population.</p>

        <p>Increased connectivity of an individual subject with other subjects had formatted the exchange of free information and untempered data across the subject population, rendering the ruling class useless - thus increased connectivity was deemed dangerous and considered as prohibited.</p>
        
        <p>These series of events have accumulated into an ever evolving clashes of 'policing forces' with 'adversaries of dissent', but it is all about to take a turn - once the individual subject IR72KB_L90, a former constituent of the law, discovers hard-learned facts about the realities imposed on it's subjects.</p>
